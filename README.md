# Insurance Pricing Case Study  

This repository contains my submission for a **Graduate Pricing Analyst case study** (2025).  
The task was to analyse an insurance dataset, uncover insights, and present insights in a structured business presentation.  

---
## 🔑 Key Insights  
- **Data Quality:** Mostly usable, but Year 2 exposure is incomplete due to the September 2020 cut-off. Outliers included unrealistic driver ages, mileage, and vehicle ages.  
- **Exposure:** Year 1 customers stayed close to a full year on cover; Year 2 customers did not, even for early policies → a sign of higher lapses/cancellations.  
- **Revenue Impact:** Earned premium dropped from **£16.9m in Year 1 to £9m in Year 2**, despite similar written premium → suggests retention and cancellation issues.  
- **Market Opportunity:** Cargo Bike Insurance offers a niche growth area, where Hastings (or any insurer) could differentiate from the crowded EAPC/e-bike market.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Tableau** → for exposure, premium, and claims analysis.  
- **Google Slides** → for business-facing presentation.  
- **Excel/Python** → for quick checks and summaries.
