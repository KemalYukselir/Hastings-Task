# Insurance Pricing Case Study  

This repository contains my submission for a **Graduate Pricing Analyst case study** (2025).  
The task was to analyse a insurance dataset, uncover insights, and present insights in a structured business presentation.

## 📊 Project Overview  
The case study was split into three parts:  

1. **Data Quality & Appropriateness**  
   - Checked the dataset for missing fields, null values, and outliers.  
   - Highlighted limitations such as partial years and immature exposure.  

2. **Year-on-Year Analysis**  
   - Compared **Year 1 (2018–2019)** with **Year 2 (2019–2020)**.  
   - Looked at written vs earned premium, exposure patterns, and claims.  
   - Found that while written premium was steady, earned premium fell sharply — partly from later policies not yet fully developed, but also from higher cancellations in Year 2.  

3. **Product Recommendation**  
   - Proposed a **Cargo Bike Insurance** product, reflecting the growth of micro-mobility and last-mile delivery.  
   - Outlined market opportunity, customer need, theft risk, and competitive positioning.

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- **Data Quality:** Mostly usable, but Year 2 exposure is incomplete due to the September 2020 cut-off. Outliers included unrealistic driver ages, mileage, and vehicle ages.  
- **Exposure:** Year 1 customers stayed close to a full year on cover; Year 2 customers did not, even for early policies → a sign of higher lapses/cancellations.  
- **Revenue Impact:** Earned premium dropped from **£16.9m in Year 1 to £9m in Year 2**, despite similar written premium → suggests retention and cancellation issues.  
- **Market Opportunity:** Cargo Bike Insurance offers a niche growth area, where Hastings (or any insurer) could differentiate from the crowded EAPC/e-bike market.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Tableau** → for exposure, premium, and claims analysis.  
- **Google Slides** → for business-facing presentation.
